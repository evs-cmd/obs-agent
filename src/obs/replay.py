"""Snapshot writer — one pretty-printed JSON file per request.

Same data as ``events.jsonl`` (today), separate file so you can
``cat replays/<request_id>.json`` after a bug report and diff against a
re-run. As deeper instrumentation lands (raw prompts, raw MCP responses)
they'll accumulate on ``RequestCtx`` and flow through here automatically.

Default sink: ``<project_root>/replays/{request_id}.json``.
